- run: `pip install pytest` to install the pytest library
- run: `pytest` to execute the test. In this current state you will notice no tests ran. Which is obvious
- create a folder where testing files will be lived. Ex: `tests` or anything you wish
- add files with `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` naming convention if you wish to pytest will automatically
    find the testing related files for you.
- add functions with naming `test_*` or `testing_*` in the test_*.py` or `*_test.py` file for auto find by pytest
- now run: `pytest` to execute the test.
- run: `pytest` with flag `-v` for Increase verbosity. EX: `pytest -v`
- run: `pytest` with flag `-s` for displaying the print statements inside the test functions.
    EX: `pytest -s`
