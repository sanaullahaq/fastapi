1- run: pip install alembic
    -stop the server if running, remove all the existing tables from the database
2- run: alembic init <folder_name>
    -folder_name: where the alembic script directory will be created
    -goto folder_name->env.py
        -import 'Base' object. So that alembic can access our models classes.
            -example: from app.models import Base
        -set target_metadata = None -> target_metadata = Base.metadata
    -goto alembic.ini
        -set 'sqlalchemy.url' there
            -however this will required the hardcoded values, 
            -so we will leave it, as it is and will set 'sqlalchemy.url' in the 'env.py' file
            -follow instruction below
    -goto env.py file
        -set 'sqlalchemy.url' with
            
            from app.config import settings
            config.set_main_option(
                "sqlalchemy.url", f'postgres+psycopg2://{settings.database_username}:{settings.database_password}@{settings.database_hostname}:{settings.database_port}/{settings.database_name}'
            )

            -the setting object contains the env variables

---Thats all for setup Alembic---
   ---To work with Alembic---
-create a revision run:`alembic revision -m "create posts table"`, similar git commit
-and implement `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` function as required.
-to run `upgrade()` or `downgrade()` from the revision file run: `alembic upgrade <revision_no.>` or `alembic downgrade <revision_no.>`
-add as many revision as you need to modify/build you db tables step by step.

---------AutoGenerated Flag-------------
The above mentioned procedure is a time consuming procedure.
You can auto generate codes with below cmd:
run: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "your revision message"`

The codes are generated based on the gap of models class and the current db state,
alembic can check our models as we hava given that permission to alembic with
`target_metadata = Base.metadata` in the env.py file of the alembic.

---------Alembic Upgrade to Head-----------------
- if you are setuping you platfrom to a platfrom and your all revisions are ready or you AutoGenerated the revisions
    first to latest and wants to upgrade from first to last at once then use the below cmd.
    - run: `alembic upgrade head`. This upgrade from current revision to head (first to last if you have not upgraded from any revision).
